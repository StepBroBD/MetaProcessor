# Session Management

This section covers MetaProcessor's session data management tool.

## Overview

What's a "session"?

A session is a data point containing raw IMU data generated by a MetaMotion device.
Clinicians uses MetaProcessor to download sessions from MetaMotion devices and then manually typed in the corresponding metadata (e.g. session ID, start/end date etc.) for each session.
All the IMU data and metadata are then bundled together and uploaded to a object store service provider.

The session data management tool can list, move, remove, upload, and download session data from local file system or on remote object store service provider.

## List Sessions

To list all sessions (local or remote), use the `ls` command:

```shell
mp object ls
```

To list remote sessions only, use the `--remote` flag:

```shell
mp object ls --remote
```

To list local sessions only, use the `--local` flag:

```shell
mp object ls --local
```

The `--remote` and `--local` flags are mutually exclusive, to list all sessions, simple omit both flags.

The output of the `ls` command can be serialized to JSON format using the `--json` flag:

```shell
mp object ls --json
```

For more information, run `mp object ls --help`.

## Move Objects

Move (or rename) objects managed by MetaProcessor.

## Remove Objects

Delete objects from MetaProcessor, local file system, or remote object store service provider.

## Upload Objects

Upload objects to remote object store service provider.

## Download Objects

Download objects from remote object store service provider.

To download all objects, use the `download` command (concurrent by default):

```shell
mp object download
```

To download a specific object, use the `--key` flag:

```shell
mp object download --key <object_key>
```

The object key can be obtained by running the `ls` command.

The `download` command is lazy, it will only download the object if it doesn't exist locally, or local object's checksum doesn't match the remote object's checksum.

For more information, run `mp object download --help`.
