# Configuring MetaProcessor

This section covers configurations options.

## Initialization

On initial installation, run:

```bash
mp config init
```

It'll create a new file located at `~/.config/metaprocessor/config.toml` and open it in your default editor (vim if `$EDITOR` is not set).

Interactive setup is also avaiable, run:

```bash
mp config init --interactive
```
