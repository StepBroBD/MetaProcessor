# Configuring MetaProcessor

This section covers configurations options.

## Initialization

On initial installation, run:

```shell
mp config init
```

This will create a new file located at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/metaprocessor/config.toml` (`~/.config/metaprocessor/config.toml` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set).

Interactive setup is also avaiable, run:

```shell
mp config init --interactive
```

If configuration is already present, an error will be thrown. To overwrite the existing configuration, run:

```shell
mp config init --force
```

## Edit

To edit the configuration file, run:

```shell
mp config edit
```

This will open the configuration file in the default editor (as specified by the `EDITOR` environment variable), if the editor is not set, it will use `vim`.

If the configuration file is not present, an error will be thrown. To create a new configuration file, run:

```shell
mp config init
```

## Check

Use the following command to check the configuration file:

```shell
mp config check
```

There are two types of checks:

1. Unfilled Options check: This is to check if there are any unfilled options in the configuration file. If there are any unfilled options, an error will be thrown.
2. Invalid Type check: This is to check if the type of the options are correct. If there are any invalid types, an error will be thrown.

If the configuration file is not present, an error will be thrown. To create a new configuration file, run:

```shell
mp config init
```

## Show

This command is to show the configuration file:

```shell
mp config show
```

If no flag is specified, the configuration file will be printed to the console in a human-readable format.

If the `--json` flag is specified, the configuration file will be printed to the console in JSON format, it can be further processed by other programs like `jq`.

If the configuration file is not present, an error will be thrown. To create a new configuration file, run:

```shell
mp config init
```

## Example

```toml
[general]
utc-offset = -7.0
gd-location = "~/MetaProcessor/Data/"
gp-regex = "*"
sg-regex = "(END|AEO)[0-9]{3}" # END or AEO followed by 3 digits
sp-regex = "BHC[0-9]{4}-[0-9]" # BHC followed by 4 digits and a dash and a digit
sd-regex = "D[0-9]{3}"         # D followed by 3 digits

[aws]
bucket = "<bucket name>"
access-key = "<access key>"
secret-key = "<secret key>"
```

## Configuration Options

The configuration file is a [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) file. The following options are available:

### `general`

It contains general configuration options.

#### `general.utc-offset`

This option is to convert MetaWear recorded IMU data timestamp from UTC to your local time zone, representing the offset in hours from UTC.

##### Type

`float`

##### Default

`0.0`

##### Example

If you are in UTC+8, the value should be `8.0`; if you are in UTC-5, the value should be `-5.0`.

##### Note

If you are located in UTC+0, the value should be `0.0`.

#### `general.gd-location`

This option is to specify the location of the global data storage, it is used to store the data from MetaWear devices, or to store downloaded data using the optional daemon.

##### Type

`string`

##### Default

`` (empty string)

##### Example

`/home/user/data` or `C:\Users\user\data`

##### Note

Although relative paths are supported, it is recommended to use absolute paths.

If you are using the optional daemon, you should specify a location that is accessible by the daemon with correct permissions.

#### `general.gp-regex`

This option is to specify the regex to match the global project ID. It must be a valid Python regex.

##### Type

`string`

##### Default

`*`

##### Example

`"^[0-9]{4}$"` to match 4-digit numbers.

##### Note

TOML cannot escape backslashes, so you should use double backslashes in the regex. For example: it is recommended to use `[0-9]` instead of `\d` in the regex

Remember not to use the `^` and `$` symbols in the regex, as they are used to match the beginning and end of the string.

The file will be named as `project ID` + `study group ID` + `study participant ID` + `recording device ID` + `file type`.

#### `general.sg-regex`

This option is to specify the regex to match the study group ID. It must be a valid Python regex.

##### Type

`string`

##### Default

`*`

##### Example

`"^[0-9]{4}$"` to match 4-digit numbers.

##### Note

TOML cannot escape backslashes, so you should use double backslashes in the regex. For example: it is recommended to use `[0-9]` instead of `\d` in the regex

Remember not to use the `^` and `$` symbols in the regex, as they are used to match the beginning and end of the string.

The file will be named as `project ID` + `study group ID` + `study participant ID` + `recording device ID` + `file type`.

#### `general.sp-regex`

This option is to specify the regex to match the study participant ID. It must be a valid Python regex.

##### Type

`string`

##### Default

`*`

##### Example

`"^[0-9]{4}$"` to match 4-digit numbers.

##### Note

The file will be named as `project ID` + `study group ID` + `study participant ID` + `recording device ID` + `file type`.

#### `general.sd-regex`

This option is to specify the regex to match the recording device ID. It must be a valid Python regex.

##### Type

`string`

##### Default

`*`

##### Example

`"^[0-9]{4}$"` to match 4-digit numbers.
