# Extending MetaProcessor

You can extend MetaProcessor by forking the [repository](https://github.com/stepbrobd/metaprocessor).
If you find your extension useful and should be made generally available, please consider contributing it back to the project.

## Development

MetaProcessor is built using [Nix](https://nixos.org), to reduce the complexity of setting up the development environment.
To get started, install Nix on your system using either the official [installation instructions](https://nixos.org/download.html)
or the [Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/determinatesystems/nix-installer)(recommended).

With Nix installed, you can a start development shell with all the dependencies needed to build MetaProcessor with [`direnv`](https://direnv.net):

```shell
git clone git@github.com:stepbrobd/metaprocessor.git && cd metaprocessor && direnv allow
```

After the console stops making outputs, MetaProcessor is already installed (editable) in your environment.
`direnv` will load and unload the environment automatically when you enter and leave the directory.
To make sure everything is working:

```shell
mp --help
```

After this, change the remote to your fork and start hacking!
