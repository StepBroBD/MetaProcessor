# Running Workflows

Running MetaProcessor workflows, available workflows are:

- `preprocessor`: preprocessor workflow, use all locally store session data and prepare them for next steps of calculations.
- `steps`: run all local session data through steps/day algorithm, results will be saved to `<Session ID>-Results.csv` file.
- `uptime`: run all local session data through uptime algorithm, results will be saved to `<Session ID>-Results.csv` file.
- `report`: report generation workflow, use all locally store results and produces a `.csv` file with all results to current working directory.

## Preprocessor

Before running steps/day or uptime algorithms, you need to run preprocessor workflow to prepare all session data for next steps.

To run preprocessor workflow for all sessions stored locally, run:

```shell
mp run preprocess
```

To run preprocessor workflow for specific session, run:

```shell
mp run preprocess --key <KEY>
```

Please note that preprocessor will only run for sessions that are saved locally.
If you are getting errors, please check if you have [downloaded the session data](/docs/object).

## Steps/Day

To run steps/day algorithm for all sessions stored locally, run:

```shell
mp run steps
```

To run steps/day algorithm for specific session, run:

```shell
mp run steps --key <KEY>
```

Please note that steps/day algorithm will only run for sessions that are saved locally, and have been preprocessed.
If you are getting errors, please check if you have [downloaded the session data](/docs/object) and [run preprocessor](#preprocessor).

Results will be saved to `<Session ID>-Results.csv` file, to get the results, find the file with corresponding session ID,
or, check [report generation](#report-generation) section.

## Upright Position Time

To run uptime algorithm for all sessions stored locally, run:

```shell
mp run uptime
```

To run uptime algorithm for specific session, run:

```shell
mp run uptime --key <KEY>
```

Please note that uptime algorithm will only run for sessions that are saved locally, and have been preprocessed.
If you are getting errors, please check if you have [downloaded the session data](/docs/object) and [run preprocessor](#preprocessor).

Results will be saved to `<Session ID>-Results.csv` file, to get the results, find the file with corresponding session ID,
or, check [report generation](#report-generation) section.
