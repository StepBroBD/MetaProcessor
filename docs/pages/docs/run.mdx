# Running Workflows

Running MetaProcessor workflows, available workflows are:

- `preprocessor`: preprocessor workflow, use all locally store session data and prepare them for next steps of calculations.
- `steps`: run all local session data through steps/day algorithm, results will be saved to `<Session ID>-Results.csv` file.
- `uptime`: run all local session data through uptime algorithm, results will be saved to `<Session ID>-Results.csv` file.
- `report`: report generation workflow, use all locally store results and produces a `.csv` file with all results to current working directory.

## Preprocessor

Before running steps/day or uptime algorithms, you need to run preprocessor workflow to prepare all session data for next steps.

To run preprocessor workflow for all sessions stored locally, run:

```shell
mp run preprocess
```

To run preprocessor workflow for specific session, run:

```shell
mp run preprocess --key <KEY>
```

Please note that preprocessor will only run for sessions that are saved locally.
If you are getting errors, please check if you have [downloaded the session data](/docs/object).

## Steps/Day

To run steps/day algorithm for all sessions stored locally, run:

```shell
mp run steps
```

To run steps/day algorithm for specific session, run:

```shell
mp run steps --key <KEY>
```

Please note that steps/day algorithm will only run for sessions that are saved locally, and have been preprocessed.
If you are getting errors, please check if you have [downloaded the session data](/docs/object) and [run preprocessor](#preprocessor).

Results will be saved to `<Session ID>-Results.csv` file, to get the results, find the file with corresponding session ID,
or, check [report generation](#report-generation) section.

## Upright Position Time

To run uptime algorithm for all sessions stored locally, run:

```shell
mp run uptime
```

To run uptime algorithm for specific session, run:

```shell
mp run uptime --key <KEY>
```

Please note that uptime algorithm will only run for sessions that are saved locally, and have been preprocessed.
If you are getting errors, please check if you have [downloaded the session data](/docs/object) and [run preprocessor](#preprocessor).

Results will be saved to `<Session ID>-Results.csv` file, to get the results, find the file with corresponding session ID,
or, check [report generation](#report-generation) section.

## Report Generation

After running object download, preprocessor, steps/day and uptime algorithms, you can generate a report for all sessions or specific session.

To generate report for all sessions, run:

```shell
mp run report
```

To generate report for specific session, run:

```shell
mp run report --key <KEY>
```

The report generator will go through all locally stored results (`<Session ID>-Results.csv`) and generate a `.csv` file to current working directory, with all saved results.

The format of the report is:

```csv
id, day_1, day_2, ..., day_n
<Session ID>, <Feature 1>, <Feature 2>, ..., <Feature n>
```

For example:

UpTime report may look like `mp-report-yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss-uptime.csv`:

```csv
id,day_1,day_2,day_3,day_4,day_5,day_6,day_7,day_8,day_9,day_10,day_11,day_12,day_13,day_14,day_15,day_16,day_17,day_18,day_19,day_20,day_21,day_22,day_23,day_24

```

Steps/Day report may look like `mp-report-yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss-steps_count.csv`:

```csv
id,day_1,day_2,day_3,day_4,day_5,day_6,day_7,day_8,day_9,day_10,day_11,day_12,day_13,day_14,day_15,day_16,day_17,day_18,day_19,day_20,day_21,day_22,day_23,day_24
AEO000-BHC0000-0-D00-Visit-0,5224,5053,6678,4988,3211,2340,217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
