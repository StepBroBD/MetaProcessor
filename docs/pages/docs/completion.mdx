# Enabling Shell Completion

MetaProcessor CLI supports shell completion for `bash`, `zsh`, and `fish`.

## General

To enable shell completion, run the following command (modification required, do not copy/paste directly):

```shell
eval "$(mp|metaprocessor completion bash|zsh|fish)"
```

Depending on your preferences, you should use either `mp` or `metaprocessor` in the command above (no difference).
Also, you should replace `bash|zsh|fish` with the shell you are using.
In the following guides, we will use `mp` for simplicity.

## Bash

To enable shell completion for `bash`, run the following command:

```shell
eval "$(mp completion bash)"
```

To enable shell completion for `bash` at the start of each interactive shell session, run the following command:

```shell
echo 'eval "$(mp completion bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

and restart your shell session.

## Zsh

To enable shell completion for `zsh`, run the following command:

```shell
eval "$(mp completion zsh)"
```

To enable shell completion for `zsh` at the start of each interactive shell session, run the following command:

```shell
echo 'eval "$(mp completion zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

and restart your shell session.

## Fish

To enable shell completion for `fish`, run the following command:

```shell
mp completion fish | source
```

To enable shell completion for `fish` at the start of each interactive shell session, run the following command:

```shell
mp completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/mp.fish
```

and restart your shell session.
